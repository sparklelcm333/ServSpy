The TCP Server APIs
===================

TCP Server setup API
--------------------

The TCP Server Setup API is used to create a TCP server. 
The server in the protocol is usually used to connect and 
listen to the TCP clients and handle the data from the 
clients.

.. code-block:: python

    class TCP_Server_Base:
        def __init__(
            self: Self,
            host: Any,
            port: Any,
            max_clients: Any,
            port_add_step: Any,
            port_range_num: Any,
            max_file_transfer_thread_num: Any,
            is_hand_alloc_port: Any,
            is_input_command_in_console: Any,
            max_custom_workers: Any,
            is_extend_command: Any=False) -> None:
            ...

The TCP Server Setup API is defined in the ``TCP_Server_Base`` class.
The parameters of the ``__init__`` method are as follows:

- ``host``: The host IP address to bind the TCP server to.
- ``port``: The port number to bind the TCP server to.
- ``max_clients``: The maximum number of concurrent clients the server can handle.
- ``port_add_step``: The step size for incrementing the port number.
- ``port_range_num``: The number of ports to check in the range.
- ``max_file_transfer_thread_num``: The maximum number of threads for file transfer operations.
- ``is_hand_alloc_port``: A flag indicating whether to manually allocate the port.
- ``is_input_command_in_console``: A flag indicating whether to input commands in the console.
- ``max_custom_workers``: The maximum number of custom worker threads.

All parameters have default values:

- ``host``: Default is ``'127.0.0.1'``
- ``port``: Default is ``65432``
- ``max_clients``: Default is ``10``
- ``port_add_step``: Default is ``1``
- ``port_range_num``: Default is ``100``
- ``max_file_transfer_thread_num``: Default is ``10``
- ``is_hand_alloc_port``: Default is ``False``
- ``is_input_command_in_console``: Default is ``True``
- ``max_custom_workers``: Default is ``10``
- ``is_extend_command``: Default is ``False`` 
  (when ``True``, ``__init__`` will not call ``start_TCP_Server()`` automatically)

The TCP Server Setup API will initialize all the necessary 
parameters and resources for the TCP server.

*Note: By default ``TCP_Server_Base.__init__`` calls 
``start_TCP_Server()`` to start the server automatically. 
If you set ``is_extend_command=True``, the instance will 
not auto-start and you should call ``start_TCP_Server()`` 
manually when ready.*

.. code-block:: python

    def start_TCP_Server(self: Self) -> Any:
        ...

In the `start_TCP_Server` method, we first create a 
TCP server socket and bind it to the ``self.host`` and 
``self.port`` which are initialized in the ``__init__`` method. 

*Note: The server socket which is set up in the `start_TCP_Server` 
method is based on IPv4 form.*

Secondly, according to the ``self.is_input_command_in_console`` 
parameter, we will start a thread to listen to the console 
input of the server or not.

After that, a main loop to accept clients will be started.

*Note: there is another global variable ``self.running`` 
which is set to ``True`` after the server socket is 
successfully created. The ``self.running`` variable is 
used to control the main loop of the TCP server, and it 
will be set to ``False`` when the server is shutting down.*

The main loop of the TCP server setup function first checks whether the number
of connected clients exceeds the maximum number of clients. The maximum number
of clients is defined by the ``self.max_clients`` argument of the
`TCP_Server_Base` class, which is initialized in ``__init__``.

If the number of the clients is already over the limit of the connect 
number, the server will send an overload message and close the connection. 
But if it does not exceed the limit, the server will set up a client
handler function `handle_client` and the server handler function 
is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def handle_client(
        self: Self, client_socket: Any, client_address: Any) -> Any:
        ...

*Note: For more details of the `handle_client` function, 
see the :ref:`tcp-server-handling-information-api` section.*

So what can the setup function do if it fails? 

First, the try-except block in the main server loop checks whether the
error is an ``OSError``. If it is, the
main loop will exit directly.

Secondly, if the error is from the network socket, it first logs the error
message and also stops the server by calling 
the function `stop`. And the stop function has been defined as: 

.. code-block:: python

    def stop(self: Self) -> None:
        ...

To stop the TCP server, it first sets the ``self.running``
variable to False, to stop the main loop of the server. 
After that, it calls the `free_port` function to free the 
port which has been allocated. And the `free_port` has been 
defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def free_port(self: Self) -> None:
        ...

*Note: For more details of the `free_port` function, 
see the :ref:`tcp-server-port-allocation-api` section.*

At the end of the operations, the TCP server closes all client sockets stored in the
``self.clients`` dictionary and also closes the server socket.

*Note: The ``self.clients`` variable is a dictionary that 
maps client address tuples to an info dictionary. The 
key is the client address tuple (``(ip, port)``) and the 
value is a dictionary containing connection details such 
as ``'socket'``, ``'address'``, ``'id'``, and ``'connected_time'``. 
See the example below which shows how entries are stored.*

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    # client_address: tuple e.g. ('127.0.0.1', 12345)
    # client_socket: socket.socket
    # client_id = f"{client_address[0]}:{client_address[1]}"
    self.clients[client_address] = {
        'socket': client_socket,
        'address': client_address,
        'id': client_id,
        'connected_time': datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}

.. _tcp-server-handling-information-api:

TCP Server handling information API
-----------------------------------

The server handling information API documents the core TCP 
server methods that manage client sockets, receive raw data, 
and send messages.

.. code-block:: python

    def handle_client(
        self: Self,
        client_socket: Any,
        client_address: Any) -> None:
        ...

`handle_client` is the main per-client handler in 
``TCP_Server_Base``. It is invoked after a client 
connection is accepted and is responsible for:

- adding the client entry into ``self.clients`` with socket, address, id, and connected time
- printing connection information and current client count
- sending a welcome message to the client
- broadcasting ``/client_alloc_port_range`` information to all clients depending on port allocation mode

*Note: You can specify the port allocation mode in 
the arguments which have been defined in the 
``TCP_Server_Base`` class. The args which you can 
change are ``port_add_step``, ``port_range_num`` 
and ``is_hand_alloc_port``.*

- receiving raw bytes from the socket using `receive_message`
- buffering incoming data until newline-terminated messages are complete
- splitting and processing each message line-by-line
- routing special commands beginning with ``/`` to `handle_command`

The `handle_command` function is defined as: 

.. code-block:: python

    def handle_command(
        self: Self,
        client_socket: Any,
        client_address: Any,
        command: Any) -> None:
        ...

In `handle_command`, there are variable conditional 
branches to handle built-in commands like ``/help``, 
``/time``, ``/clients``, ``/quit``, and some file 
transfer commands. If you already added more commands 
by the command extension API, the function will 
determine if the input message matches the extension 
commands.

*Note: For more details of the command extension API 
and the built-in commands, see the :ref:`tcp-server-command-api` section.*

- logging normal chat messages and acknowledging receipt
- removing the client from ``self.clients`` and closing the socket when the client disconnects or an error occurs

.. code-block:: python

    def receive_message(
        self: Self,
        client_socket: Any,
        msg_length: Int) -> Any:
        ...

`receive_message` is a thin wrapper around socket 
receive operations. It reads up to ``msg_length`` 
bytes from the given ``client_socket`` and 
returns the raw byte payload. Message decoding 
and newline message framing are handled by the 
caller.

.. code-block:: python

    def send_message(
        self: Self,
        client_socket: Any,
        message: Any) -> True|False:
        ...

`send_message` sends data back to a specific connected client.
It verifies the server is running and the socket is valid, then:

- accepts both ``str`` and ``bytes`` message payloads
- trims string payloads and appends a newline if missing
- encodes string payloads as UTF-8
- sends the complete message with ``client_socket.sendall(data)``
- returns ``True`` on success, otherwise logs the error and returns ``False``

And there are also some other functions which are 
used to send message in bulk to the clients, such 
as the `broadcast` function and the `send_msg_to_specific_client` 
function.

.. code-block:: python

    def broadcast(
        self: Self,
        message: Any,
        exclude_client: Any=None) -> None:
        ...

The `broadcast` function sends a message to all clients in the
``self.clients`` dictionary and removes clients that are already
disconnected from the server. And if the ``exclude_client`` parameter 
is not ``None``, the server will exclude the client 
which is specified by the ``exclude_client`` parameter 
when sending the message.

.. code-block:: python

    def send_msg_to_specific_client(
        self: Self,
        message: Any) -> None:
        ...

The `send_msg_to_specific_client` function sends one or more messages to
one or more specific clients by their client IDs. The ``message`` argument
should contain a command message to send.

These methods form the server's client I/O loop 
and ensure reliable message exchange for connected 
TCP clients.

.. _tcp-server-command-api:

TCP Server command API
----------------------

The server supports several built-in commands 
and a command extension API. The main entry 
point is the `handle_command` method, which 
is invoked for any message starting with ``/``.

We support two solutions for command handling:
inputting a command in the console or
receiving a command from other clients. You can also call the
functions defined for each command in the code.

*Note: You can select the solution which you 
want to use by changing the args of the 
`TCP_Server_Base` class, the arg is 
``is_input_command_in_console``. ``True`` allows
the server to input the command in
console, while ``False`` does not allow it.*

Built-in client commands include:

- ``/help``: returns the available command list and usage hints.
- ``/time``: returns the current server time.
- ``/clients``: returns the list of connected client IDs.
- ``/quit``: returns a goodbye message and disconnects the client.
- ``/file <file_path> <client_id>``: starts a file transfer request from client to server.
- ``/file_folder <folder_path> <client_id>``: starts a folder transfer request from client to server.
- ``/server_file_transfer_port <port> <client_id>``: internal protocol message used to coordinate file transfer ports.

In `handle_command`, the server will first 
check if the command matches any built-in commands. 
If it does, the `handle_command` will call the 
functions which are defined for the commands.

If a command is not recognized by the built-in handler, 
`handle_command` will check if it matches any 
registered custom commands from the command extension 
API. If the command is already registered, the 
`handle_command` will call the function defined 
for that command. The command extension API is 
defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def register_command(
        self: Self,
        command_name: Any,
        handler: Any,
        where_to_run: Any,
        run_in_thread: Any=False) -> bool:
        ...

The args of the `register_command` function 
are as follows:

- ``command_name``: The name of the command to register.

*Note: The ``command_name`` should start with a slash 
(e.g., ``/my_command``) to be recognized as a command.*

- ``handler``: The function to call when the command is received.

*Note: The ``handler`` function must have exactly three parameters:
``client_socket``, ``client_address``, 
and ``command``. ``client_socket`` will be accepted as the 
network socket object that sent the command, ``client_address`` 
will be accepted as the address of the client that sent the 
command, while the ``command`` parameter will contain the actual 
command string.*

- ``where_to_run``: Specifies where the command should be executed.
- ``run_in_thread``: A boolean indicating whether to run the command in a separate thread.

This extension API allows server-side and 
console-side custom commands to be registered 
dynamically. Valid values for ``where_to_run`` 
are ``"server"`` and ``"client"``. The ``"server"`` 
means the command will be handled when a client 
sends the command, while the ``"client"`` means 
the command will be handled when the server input 
the command in console.

*Note: It's true that the valid values for ``where_to_run`` 
are not ideal, but we have not yet found a better way to
define that.*

The ways to run the command will be different 
according to the args ``run_in_thread``. If 
``run_in_thread`` is ``True``, the command handler 
will be executed in a separate thread from the 
server's thread pool. If ``run_in_thread`` is 
``False``, the command handler will be executed 
synchronously in the main server thread.

*Note: We store the registered commands in a list variable
with two dictionaries in its inner layer, and the list variable
is defined as ``self._custom_handlers`` which is initialized in
the `__init__` method. The command and its handler will be
stored in one of the dictionaries according to the value
of ``where_to_run``. For ``"server"``, it will be stored in
the first dictionary, otherwise in the second dictionary.
And the keys of the dictionaries are the command names,
and the value is another dictionary containing the handler
function. And there is also another list variable defined as 
``self._custom_handler_threaded`` which is initialized in the 
`__init__` method, it contains all the commands that should 
be run in a separate thread or not.*

.. code-block:: python

    self._custom_handlers = [{}, {}]
    self._custom_handler_threaded = [{}, {}]

After that, the command handler will be called according to 
the command name, and run them by a command executor which 
is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def _execute_custom_handler(
        self:Self,
        handler:Any,
        command:Any,
        client_socket:Any=None,
        client_address:Any=None) -> Any:
        ...

In this executor function, there is a try-except code 
block to catch the error when running the command handler. 
If there is an error when running the command handler, the 
server will log the error message and also send the error 
message back to the client if the command is from the client 
side. And in the try code block, the command handler will be 
called with the command arguments, and also the client 
socket and client address if the command is from the client 
side.

If the command doesn't run in the thread, the command executor 
will be called directly in the `handle_command` function. 
But if the command should run in a separate thread, the command 
executor will be submitted to the server's thread pool using 
the `submit_task` method, which is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def submit_task(
        self: Self,
        func: Any,
        *args: Any,
        **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        ...

The `submit_task` method is a helper function that submits 
a callable to the server's internal thread pool executor. 
It accepts a function and its arguments, and schedules it 
for execution in a separate thread. This allows long-running 
or blocking command handlers to run without blocking the 
main server loop.

In this high-level TCP network protocol, a temporary TCP server
and client can also be created very simply. The temporary
TCP server or client can be used for scenarios that need
additional sockets or ports to avoid conflicts with
the main server or client loop. For example, file transfer 
functions. The APIs to create temporary TCP server and client 
are defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def create_temporary_server(
        self: Self,
        handler: Any,
        port: Any=None,
        max_connections: Any=1) -> Any:
        ...

    def create_temporary_client(
        self: Self,
        server_host: Any,
        server_port: Any,
        bind_port: Any=None,
        on_data: Any=None) -> Any:
        ...

.. _tcp-server-console-commands:

TCP Server console commands
---------------------------

The server console input thread accepts administrative 
commands when ``is_input_command_in_console`` is ``True``. 
Supported console commands include:

- ``/stop``: stops the server and closes all active connections.
- ``/status``: prints the current connection count and running state.
- ``/clients``: prints the connected clients and their connection times.
- ``/send_msg <message...> <client_id1> <client_id2> ...``: sends one or more messages to specific clients.
- ``/file <file_path> <client_id>``: sends a file from the server to a specific client.
- ``/file_folder <folder_path> <client_id>``: sends a folder from the server to a specific client.
- ``/multiple_file_multiple_client <file1> <file2> ... <client1> <client2> ...``: sends multiple files to multiple clients.
- ``/diff_multiple_file_diff_multiple_client <file1> <file2> ... <client1> <client2> ...``: sends different file lists to different clients.
- ``/help``: prints a help summary of console commands.

These console commands make it easy to manage the 
active server and perform server-initiated file 
transfers without modifying the code.

*Note: It is too long to introduce all the console 
commands, so for more details see the :ref:`tcp-server-console-commands` section.*

TCP Server file transfer API
----------------------------

The TCP server contains a file transfer subsystem 
that supports both client-to-server and server-to-client 
transfers.

It's too long to introduce all the file transfer functions, 
so there is only the list of APIs for the file transfer 
functions, and for more details of the file transfer 
functions, please visit ...

The file transfer API for you to use includes:

The basic function for the server-to-client 
file transfer is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def file_transfer_server_recv_client_start(
        self: Self,
        message: Any,
        file_folder_abspath: Any) -> None|False:
        ...

The file transfer function which will run in 
the threads is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def file_transfer_server_recv_client_start_thread(
        self: Self,
        message: Any,
        file_folder_abspath: Any=None) -> None:
        ...

The folder transfer function is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def folder_file_transfer_server_recv_client_start(
        self: Self,
        message: Any) -> None|False:
        ...

The multiple files transfer to multiple clients 
function is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def multiple_file_multiple_client_transfer_server_recv_client_start(
        self: Self,
        message: Any) -> None|False:
        ...

The different multiple files transfer to the 
different multiple clients function is defined as:

.. code-block:: python

    def diff_multiple_file_diff_multiple_client_transfer_server_recv_client_start(
        self: Self,
        message: Any) -> None|False:
        ...

We recommend that if you want to use the mono-file 
transfer function, use the `file_transfer_server_recv_client_start_thread` 
function first, unless the functions which called the 
mono-file transfer function are already in a separate 
thread, then you can call the `file_transfer_server_recv_client_start` 
function directly, or the file transfer functions
may not be very stable. And for the other file transfer
functions, we don't recommend using them in 
threads, because there are already some thread control 
mechanisms in the functions, so there is no need to worry about
concurrency. And if you call them in 
threads, there may be some unexpected errors and also 
unnecessary complexity.

*Note: The file transfer API functions are designed to be 
called from the command handlers for both client-initiated 
and server-initiated transfers. They handle the coordination 
of transfer ports, client connections, and the actual file 
data transfer operations.*

Client-to-server transfer flow:

1. The client sends ``/file`` or ``/file_folder`` to 
   request a transfer.
2. ``handle_command`` starts a dedicated file-server 
   thread using ``file_transfer_server_recv_server_start_thread``.
3. The server allocates an ephemeral transfer port 
   with ``palloc`` and sends 
   ``/server_file_transfer_port <port> <client_id>`` 
   back to the client.
4. The client connects to that transfer port and sends 
   file metadata, including length-prefixed filename 
   and file size.
5. The server receives the file and writes it under 
   ``received_files``.

Server-to-client transfer flow:

- ``file_transfer_server_recv_client_start`` is used to initiate outgoing
  transfers from server to a connected client.
- The server sends transfer commands to the client socket and waits for the
  client to establish the file transfer connection.
- Folder transfers are performed recursively, with each file transfer respecting
  ``self.max_file_transfer_thread_num`` and the configured semaphore limit.

Common file transfer helper methods include:

- ``file_transfer_server_recv_server_start``: receives file data from a client.
- ``file_transfer_server_recv_client_start``: sends a file or folder to a client.
- ``file_transfer_mode``: performs the low-level client-side transfer handshake.
- ``file_transfer_mode_recv``: performs the low-level receive-side transfer handshake.

.. _tcp-server-port-allocation-api:

Port allocation API
-------------------

The server allocation APIs allow you to allocate a new 
port for other servers. There are two kinds of port 
allocation modes.

To change the port allocation mode, you can set the
``is_hand_alloc_port`` argument on the server instance. 
When set to ``False``, the server instance will choose
the automatic port allocation mode, or set to ``True``
it will choose the manual allocation mode.

We strongly recommend using the automatic port 
allocation mode, which is the default mode of the server, 
because the automatic port allocation mode is more 
simple and also more stable than the manual port 
allocation mode. In this mode, when calling the 
allocation APIs, it will return ``0``.

*Note: The `bind` function in standard lib `socket` 
of the python executor, when input ``0`` to the port 
parameter, will automatically assign an available port 
by operating system.*

The other port allocation mode is the manual port 
allocation mode, there is a port allocation range 
for the server. Please avoid opening other servers 
in the same host, because in the existing version, 
the port range may conflict and may cause
unexpected errors.

The range of the port allocation is configured in 
the server settings. The minimum allocatable port is 
``self.port-self.port_add_step*self.port_range_num``, 
and the maximum allocatable port is 
``self.port+1+self.port_add_step*self.port_range_num``.

*Note: The ``self.port`` is the ``port`` argument of the
server class. The ``self.port_add_step`` is the
``port_add_step`` argument. And the
``self.port_range_num`` is the ``port_range_num``
argument.*

There are some relevant methods that can be used:

.. code-block:: python

    def palloc(self: Self) -> int:
        ...

The `palloc` method allows you to get a port. When
using this function, you don't need to worry about
the port allocation mode, because an allocation mode
detector is already implemented in this method.

.. code-block:: python

    def pfree(
        self: Self,
        port: int) -> None|int:
        ...

The `pfree` method allows you to free a port. Like the
`palloc` method, you don't need to worry about the
port allocation mode when using this method.

And there are the main functions for you to call, 
and for more information about the port allocation 
functions, see the :ref:`tcp-server-port-allocation-api` section.

This mode is useful when you need an individual port for 
the server or  must reserve a controlled range of ports 
for client-file transfers by manual port allocation, 
such as in a testing environment or when multiple 
server processes share the same host.
